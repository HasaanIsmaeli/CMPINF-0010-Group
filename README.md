We went with the GNU License because it was the best License for software development out of the 3 choices(MIT, Apache, and GNU). It was also gave more in depth Terms and conditions. The GNU License talks heavily about all the copyright laws that can be put in place if those things to happen, so it would make sense for us to have that in this file, because copyright is a big issue in the world. Also, explains things you can and can't do regarding the code, just to enforce those rules. We decided to go with a CoC template from github because it covers mostly all the things we think is necessary to have a great and safe environment for people using our software. To add on, the CoC states that nothing inappropriate should be in said code, and if things like that do appear, then there are violations that can arise due to the violations if they do appear, but with our code that doesn't appear, but if changes from other people were made, it would make sense for the CoC to be put in place.
